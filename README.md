## Installation
1. Download [RTXLauncher](https://github.com/Xenthio/RTXLauncher/releases/latest).
2. Put `RTXLauncher.exe` in an empty folder, run it as an <ins>**Administrator**</ins>
   - Do not place in the same place as your vanilla game
   - Do not place it in a OneDrive synced folder (Documents, Desktop, etc), the game will not launch if you do so
4. Select `Run Quick Install` on the main screen and follow the prompts when asked.
5. Once it's finished, press `Launch Game` at the bottom of the launcher.

## Multiplayer
Multiplayer works best when the server/host has this addon and the cvar `sv_allowcslua 1` set.

You can join servers without the addon but you ***will*** experience visual issues.
